# Movements and Physics

Learn how to implement movements to our square object and apply some basics physics to it.

## Proccess

Start at 24/01/2025.

- [x] Move the square on the screen. (24/01/2025 - 18:32:13)
    - Create a square that moves when arrow keys are pressed.
    - Implement limits to prevent our square to move out of the edges of screen.
- [ ] Simulate the gravity. (24/01/2025 - 21:58:23)
    - Make the square falldown slowly from the center of the screen to the bottom of the screem.
    - Add a key (space) to make the square jumps.
